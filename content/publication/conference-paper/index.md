abstract: Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) are coherent ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones. They are a major source of moisture for the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), where moisture acts as a potent greenhouse gas and WCB-associated cirrus clouds contribute to cloud radiative forcing. However, the processes controlling WCB moisture transport and cloud properties are poorly characterised. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed (embedded) convection as a ubiquitous feature of WCBs, highlighting the importance of understanding their updraught and microphysical structure. We present a Lagrangian investigation of WCB moisture transport for a case from the WISE (Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange) campaign based on a convection-permitting simulation. Lagrangian non-dimensional metrics of the moisture budget suggest that the ascent timescale (τ600) strongly controls the end-of-ascent total moisture content, which is largest for slowly ascending trajectories (τ600≥20 h, 30 % of all WCB trajectories). This is due to relatively warm end-of-ascent temperatures and the strong temperature control on transported water vapour. Deviations from equilibrium water vapour condensate partitioning are largest for slow trajectories due to faster glaciation and lower ice crystal numbers. A local moisture transport minimum at intermediate τ600 results from a shift towards a riming-dominated precipitation formation pathway and decreasing outflow temperatures with decreasing τ600. The fastest trajectories (τ600≤5 h, 5 % of all WCB trajectories) transport the largest condensate mass to the UTLS due to less efficient condensate loss and produce the longest-lived outflow cirrus clouds. Models that parameterise convection may under-represent these processes, potentially impacting weather forecasts and climate predictions.
